  about: {
    paragraph1: "I am a graduating Information Technology student at the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines (USTP). With a strong foundation in full-stack development, I specialize in building scalable web and mobile applications using React and Express.js. For me, coding is more than just writing code, it's about turning abstract ideas into tangible, user-friendly realities. I am constantly refining my coding practices, ensuring that the applications I build are robust, maintainable, and up to modern industry standards.",
    paragraph2: "When I'm not debugging or architecting systems, you can find me immersing myself in video games, exploring new movies, or curating music playlists. I believe that maintaining a creative balance outside of coding keeps my problem-solving skills sharp."
